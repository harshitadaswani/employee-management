# CRUD Application – React 

### The Task

A factory has employees in different departments,
We need to build a system to help manage employees, so we need screens that allow:

✔ A manager to add / update / delete employees. \
✔ See a list of employees.

#       Field Name \
1       First name \
2       Last Name \
3       Phone \
4       Email \
5       Work hours \
6       salary type \
7       salary \
8       Department \
9       Login user id \

✔ Each employee can be in only one department. \
✔ The data type in the feed must be verified and an appropriate error displayed if the feed is incorrect. \
✔ How to calculate the salary on display: \
  > ○ Type 1 - by hourly wage. \
  > ○ Type 2 - fixed each month (value of field salary). \
  > ○ Type 3 - If more than 100 hours then full pay otherwise 0.75% of pay per hour. \

Store all details in array.
